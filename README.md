# hello-world

I'm Kim. I'm an artist and a designer learning about github. I used something similar to this in the late 90s working at Barr Systems in Gainesville, FL. We used in in our daily work life as it was being developed. It was called The Barr Enterprise Model and was an "agile language for unity of purpose, productivity improvement, and quality management"

I love the simplicity of github and the way I can be connected to other creatives world-wide.
